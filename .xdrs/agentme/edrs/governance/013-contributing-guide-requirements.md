# agentme-edr-policy-013: Contributing guide requirements

## Context and Problem Statement

Projects often document contributor expectations inconsistently or only inside README files, PR templates, or tribal knowledge. That causes avoidable review churn, premature feature implementation, and unfocused pull requests.

What contributor workflow guidance must every project publish so contributors know how to report bugs, discuss features, and submit changes?

## Decision Outcome

**Every project must publish a root CONTRIBUTING.md with a small, explicit contribution workflow.**

Projects must keep a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file at the repository root. The file must explain where bugs, feature discussions, and code changes belong so contributors follow a predictable workflow before opening pull requests.

### Implementation Details

- Every project **MUST** have a root `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- The guide **MUST** direct bug reports to issues.
- The guide **MUST** direct feature ideas and feature discussions to issues before implementation starts.
- The guide **MUST** state that fixes and features are contributed through pull requests.
- The guide **MUST** state that pull requests come from feature branches targeting `main`.
- The guide **MUST** ask reviewers and contributors to use [Conventional Comments](https://conventionalcomments.org/) for review feedback.
- The guide **MUST** ask contributors to keep pull requests small enough to keep review and discussion focused.
- Project scaffolding skills **SHOULD** create the file by default when they initialize a repository.
- The content **SHOULD** stay concise and practical; do not turn `CONTRIBUTING.md` into a duplicate of `README.md`.

## Considered Options

* (REJECTED) **Keep contribution rules implicit** - Rely on README text, issue templates, or maintainers explaining the workflow ad hoc.
  * Reason: Inconsistent contributor behavior and avoidable review overhead.
* (CHOSEN) **Require a dedicated CONTRIBUTING.md** - Publish a short, explicit contribution workflow in a predictable location.
  * Reason: Easy to discover, simple to scaffold, and clear enough for both humans and agents.
